        <h3>Responsive Blog Template</h3>
        <p>A mobile-friendly blog template built with HTML5 and vanilla CSS.</p>
        <p>
          Oyoo Jerry, a passionate ICT enthusiast and advocate for inclusive
          digital experiences, was honored for his outstanding work on a
          mobile-friendly blog template built entirely with HTML5 and vanilla
          CSS. The award recognized not only the technical brilliance and
          responsive design of the template but also its deeper
          purpose—amplifying conversations around mental health awareness. With
          a clean layout, accessible navigation, and semantic structure, Oyoo’s
          blog template was thoughtfully designed to be easily readable across
          all devices, especially smartphones. He understood that many young
          people and vulnerable individuals turn to mobile platforms when
          seeking help or information about mental health. By making the
          template fast, accessible, and SEO-optimized, he ensured that
          meaningful mental health content could reach more people—especially in
          underserved communities. This award-winning project reflects Oyoo’s
          belief that technology should do more than function—it should heal,
          connect, and empower. His blog template became a tool for educators,
          therapists, and storytellers to share their experiences, offer
          support, and foster empathy, proving that even simple code can carry
          powerful messages of hope
